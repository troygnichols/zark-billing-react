# TODO

- notification that save was successful
- loading screen for heroku dyno wakeup
- re-sort line items
- user profile, store address
- autocomplete client name
- auto generate incrementing invoice id per client
- BUG: navigate after token expired weird behavior, e.g. route to /invoices/undefined
- indicate when data is not loaded yet, maybe with modal
